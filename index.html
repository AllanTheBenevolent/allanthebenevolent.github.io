            “Just a Moment” previously named NGN(Nice Guy/Girl Nation) is a project dedicated to spreading kindness and appreciation to one another. Feel good while doing good was the motto. It takes just a moment in an individual’s life to make a difference in another. The purpose of this project is to encourage individuals of this generation to take a step back from their busy, fast-paced lives and take a moment to appreciate what they have and what they are able to do. Kindness is the language we speak and we believe that a little generosity here and there can create a positive ripple effect to the community as a whole. </p>
<p>        
 I was the founder and content creator for Just A Moment. I started at the end of my freshman year as an undergrad and it gain traction quite rapidly. I lead various successful projects and campaign to promote kindness through this organization. I successfully achieved a partnership with a dance consulting firm which soon decided to adapt the concept and implement their project within their dance community.

            I was part of this program for around 2 years and served as a team lead for one of the sub projects. The team I was in was called Town and Country Learning Center. We were in charge of providing a to educate and enhance the environment for the students that attend the learning center. I was in charge of two mini projects within the group. The first project was a music application that incorporated an onsite piano that taught students basic key skills and allowed them to showcase their work. The 2nd project was a sensor system to help notify students when they would need to water and care for their plants in their gardens. I’ve logged and documented all my work for continuity. I no longer am part of the project and have passed on my work to the next generation of students taking this program.

          <p>Tastebuddies is a web application that I designed and developed for a HCI(Human Computer Interaction) design class. I managed a group of three students to develop a design prototype of the application within 10 weeks. The application’s purpose was inspired by the lack of motivation and desire for students to cook, since we believed that cooking was an essential part of life and it’s a skill that many college students lack and may benefit from learning. Through the course we did many observations and design mock ups to come up with the applications core values and functions. After many prototyping and researching we developed an application that takes in an input of ingredients and returns a list of recipes the user can create with the ingredients inputted.  We also created a gamification aspect to the application by allowing users to collect “tastebuddies” or characters as they continue to use the application and cook more recipes. The concept was to have tastebuddies become companions to cook with and be the encouragement users need to pursue the culinary arts.</p>
            
            <p>
            I was the one who introduced the idea of cooking as a need for this project and became assigned as the product manager. The development and design of the entire application was an enriching experience. I learned a lot in the technical side as well as learning how to be a product manager when dealing with design with users and addressing user and market needs.

             ΒΔΣ or Beta Delta Sigma, which stands for “Best Dim Sum” was originally a group created for entertainment purposes and just inside joke towards the Greek community. However the letters and mission concept was quite intriguing to peers and quickly gained traction and started to become a larger entity. Having the concept originally being a play on the Greek letters it soon developed into a philanthropist group. Dim Sum’s literal translation; “touch the heart” soon became a motto for the group. The motto that inspired every member to touch the hearts of all those who cross their paths and remember to always strive to be an influence to others in some positive manner. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            I was one of the four founders who never expected such a concept to gain a big traction. With the support of eager friends and colleagues, the group grew exponentially and became a popular social group that was dedicated to making a change in individuals’ lives. We did various small charities and events for the community and continue to reach out to individuals’ heart to share the culture of Dim Sum as well as the need for humanity to love one another. This organization was one of the cleverest concepts I’m proud of creating.
